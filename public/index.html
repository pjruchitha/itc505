      <p>For this project, I built a fun Mad Lib Generator using HTML, CSS, and a Node.js Express server. The idea was to create a simple form where users could input words like nouns, adjectives, verbs, a place, and a plural noun. Once submitted, the server would use those inputs to generate a playful story. To handle this, I set up the server with Express and used Morgan for logging. The form collects the inputs and sends them to the server via a POST request, where the server then creates the Mad Lib story dynamically. For the design, I used CSS to make the page look clean and modern, ensuring it's also responsive across different devices. During the setup, I ran into some permission issues when installing global packages like forever, but I was able to fix this by using sudo and later adjusting NPM to install packages locally. I thoroughly tested the application to make sure the form works as expected and that the story is generated correctly. Looking ahead, I’d like to add more story templates, improve client-side validation, and perhaps offer options for customizing the theme. Overall, this project helped me improve my skills in handling forms, server-side logic, and responsive design, and I’m really pleased with how the Mad Lib Generator turned out.</p>
